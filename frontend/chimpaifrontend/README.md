# ChimpAI Full Stack Developer Assignment - Frontend part

## Description

It is the React frontend part of the application. It is very simple, it has only
3 components, a navigation bar, a home page and a product table component.

I fetch the data from the .NET backend API and then fill a table with the data.

I should have created a search bar as well, but I am out of time, so I only created the input tag for it, I could't provide logic to it.
